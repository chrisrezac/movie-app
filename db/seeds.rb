# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# # Actor = Actor.create(
# [
#   {
#     first_name: FFaker::Name.first_name,
#     last_name: FFaker::Name.last_name,
# #     known_for: FFaker::Movie.title
# #   }

# movie = Movie.create(

#     title: "Back to the Future",
#     year: 1985,
#     plot: "Marty McFly travels back in time after using a DeLorean that was heavily modified by his eccentric scientist friend, Doc Brown."
